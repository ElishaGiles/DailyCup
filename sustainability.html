    <p class="sustain-content">Sustainability. Long-lasting results. One-on-one support. That's why I am here:
      to help you achieve optimal health. I am passionate, consistent, and determined to improve your level of confidence.
      Whether this is the first time you are meal prepping, exercising, and repeating positive affirmations or hundredth time, I
      still believe we all need the support.<br><br>Even I need the support and encouragement to keep living a healthy and
      active lifestyle. It is too easy to go out on the weekends and overindulge in fancy desserts and appetizers.
      I am not saying you can't do that, but I want to teach you to eat more intuitively. When you listen to your body,
      you will live a life you love.<br><br>
      The first Monday of each month, I will start a new, one-on-one, 8-week "Mind &
      Body" course. After registration, I will begin with a personal health and fitness analysis in person, over the phone, or
      via email in order for me to understand how I can best help YOU over the next 8 weeks.<br><br>
      Next, I will send you a grocery list, meal plan, and exercise agenda for you to complete over those 8 weeks.<br><br>
      <span style="color: #000">Why does this work?</span><br><br>
      We stay in contact on a daily basis via text, phone, Facetime or email. Every other Monday, you will send me a progress
      photo as a constant reminder of accountability. Your progress is confidential. My support and friendship is ongoing.
      You have the opportunity to win some of my favorite supplements, workout programs, and recipes!<br><br>
      If you are ready to take the 8 week "Mind & Body Challenge," please send me a message through the CONTACT icon button.<br><br>
      <span style="color: #000">I look forward to getting to know you!</span><br><br></p>
