  <p><br><br><span id="mobile-title">Hey there, I'm T!</span><br>
    <span id="mobile-subtitle">I am a wellness blogger, foodie, fitness enthusiast, and advocate of creating a life you love.</span><br>
    <span id="mobile-main-content">Cute right? Well, it hasn't always been that way. I used to be an "in the closet" writer.
    I would write poems about my break-ups, my eating disorder, drugs, and all of my insecurities.
    In 2010, while soul searching, I finally decided to launch my blog, "If passion drives you let reason hold the reigns".
    I had no intention of gaining followers.
    My only intention was to write and connect with like minded individuals who faced similar trials as my own. <br><br>
    Today, after years of failing forward I still have the same intention of connecting with like minded individuals.
    Instead of just connecting, I want to provide solutions.
    Because if I can overcome an Eating disorder that manipulates every thought of everyday,
    graduate from college after almost giving up on life, and find God through sobriety,
    then you too can turn your struggle into a strength! <br><br>
    As a passionate health coach-in-training I work with individuals looking to reclaim their bounce-outta-bed energy through high quality nutrition,
    personalized workout plans, and one on one support. <br><br>
    I currently work full time as an Aveda Master Esthetician, which I absolutely love, but where my heart lies is here.
    THIS is my soul space. You being here means the world to me.
    I hope you find something here that inspires you and makes your day a little better than it was before.</span><br><br>
    <span id="mobile-signature">I look forward to hearing your story!</span><br>
