    Sustainability. Long lasting results. One on one support. That's why I am here. To help you achieve optimal health.
    I am passionate, consistent and determined to improve your level of confidence. Whether this is the first time you are
    meal prepping, exercising and repeating positive affirmations or hundredth time I still believe we all need the
    support.<br><br>

    Even I need the support and encouragement to keep living a healthy and active lifestyle. It is too easy to go out on
    the weekends, and overindulge in fancy deserts, and appetizers. I am not saying you can't do that, but I want to teach
    you to eat more intuitively. When you listen to your body, you will live a life you love.<br><br>

    The first Monday of each month I will start a new, one on one, 8 week mind and body course. After registration, I will
    begin with a personal health and fitness analysis in person, over the phone or via email in order for me to understand
    how I can best help YOU over the next 8 weeks.<br><br>

    Next, I will send you a grocery list, meal plan and exercise agenda for you to complete over the next 8 weeks.<br><br>

    <span style="font-weight:bolder">Why does this work?</span><br><br>

    We stay in contact on a daily basis via text, phone, facetime or email.  Every other Monday you will send me a progress
    photo as a constant reminder of accountability. Your progress is confidential. My support and friendship is on going.
    You have the opportunity to win some of my favorite supplements, workout programs and recipes!<br><br>

    If you are ready to take the 8 week Mind & Body Challenge please send me a message through the CONTACT icon button.<br><br>

    <span style="font-weight:bolder">I look forward to getting to know you!</span>
