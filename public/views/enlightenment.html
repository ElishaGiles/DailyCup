      <p><br>The sole purpose of this blog is to increase my own knowledge and understanding towards our mind, body and spirit.
        I believe it is a part of my distinct calling to help illuminate the world of darkness with this inspiring information
        I am gaining. I am not perfect, nor will I ever be, but I do believe if I strive to gain more insight towards other
        people's experiences I will help illuminate their light into the world.<br><br>As you scroll through my blog you will
        read some of my favorite quotes, scriptures, and interviews, from inspiring foodies, fitness junkies and successful
        leaders. Who knows -- you might be the next story I feature!<br><br></p>
