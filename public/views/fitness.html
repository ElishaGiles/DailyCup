    As David Copperfield once said, "Stop saying I wish and start saying, I will." The moment I made a conscious
    decision to exercise for the vitality of my well-being everything shifted. I am no longer exercising because
    I hate my body, but because I love my body. With Exercise comes food and with unconscious food choices comes a
    LONG fitness journey with very little results.<br><br><br>

    Every single day I have to remind myself that God has blessed me with a mind to choose and a body to live! In return
    I must treat my mind and body with the highest form of respect possible. I am learning to love the pain, the sweat,
    and the satisfaction of achieving something I have never achieved before.<br><br><br>

    My job as a Wellness Blogger is to help you understand the benefits behind eating whole foods and exercising on a daily
    basis. You do not need to deprive yourself in order to gain results. You do not need to spend hours and hours each day
    in the gym in order to gain muscle or lose weight.

    Diets with an expiration date don't last; building mindful eating
    habits will stick with you forever. Food and exercise is just as vital as sleep. As you begin to change your mindset,
    your body will begin to follow. Gradually, as you build these healthy habits every aspect of your life will begin to
    blossom into a positive transformation!<br><br><br>

    When you sign up for my 8 week Mind & Body Challenge I will walk you through meal planning, exercising, and daily
    positive affirmations in order for you to heal and become one step closer to the person God designed you to be. </div>
