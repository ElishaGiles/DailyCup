          <p class="fitness-content">As David Copperfield once said, "Stop saying I wish and start saying, I will."
            The moment I made a conscious decision to exercise for the vitality of my well-being, everything shifted.
            I am no longer exercising because I hate my body, but because I love my body.
            With exercise comes food, and with unconscious food choices comes a LONG fitness journey with very little results.
            <br><br>Every single day I have to remind myself that God has blessed me with a mind to choose and a body to live!
            In return I must treat my mind and body with the highest form of respect possible.
            I am learning to love the pain, the sweat, and the satisfaction of achieving something I have never achieved before.
            <br><br>My job as a Wellness Blogger is to help you understand the benefits behind eating whole foods and exercising on a
            daily basis.
            You do not need to deprive yourself in order to gain results. You do not need to spend hours and hours each
            day in the gym in order to gain muscle or lose weight. Diets with an expiration date don't last;
            building mindful eating habits will stick with you forever. Food and exercise is just as vital as sleep.
            As you begin to change your mindset, your body will begin to follow. Gradually, as you build these healthy habits every
            aspect of your life will begin to blossom into a positive transformation!<br><br></p>

        <p class="about"><span id="title">Don't find time to exercise, MAKE time to exercise.</span><br>
          <span id="intro">I am a wellness blogger, foodie, fitness enthusiast,<br>and advocate of creating a life you love.</span><br><br>
          <span>Cute, right? Well, it hasn't always been that way. I used to be an "in the closet" writer.
          I would write poems about my break-ups, my eating disorder, drugs, and all of my insecurities.
          In 2010, while soul searching, I finally decided to launch my blog, "If passion drives you let reason hold the reigns".
          I had no intention of gaining followers.
          My only intention was to write and connect with like minded individuals who faced similar trials as my own. <br><br>
          Today, after years of failing forward I still have the same intention of connecting with like minded individuals.
          Instead of just connecting, I want to provide solutions,
          because if I can overcome an eating disorder that manipulates every thought of every day,
          graduate from college after almost giving up on life, and find God through sobriety,
          then you too can turn your struggle into a strength! <br><br>
          As a passionate health coach-in-training, I work with individuals looking to reclaim their "bounce-outta-bed" energy through
          high quality nutrition,
          personalized workout plans, and one-on-one support. <br><br>
          I currently work full-time as an Aveda Master Esthetician, which I absolutely love, but where my heart lies is here.
          THIS is my soul space. You being here means the world to me.
          I hope you find something here that inspires you and makes your day a little better than it was before.</span><br><br>
          <span id="signature">I look forward to hearing your story!<br><br>
